- Remote Operations (Paging, Sorting, Filtering, Grouping, Summary)
- Master Detail
- Editing
- Lookup Columns
- Calculated Columns

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
 ``` text
 git clone https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/devextreme-datagrid-with-webapi.git
 ```

2. Open the `datagrid-webapi/datagrid-webapi.sln` solution in Visual Studio 2015 or higher.
